This interface exposes all the aspects of the InFoLiS data model, presenting
all the information that is contained in our central [*schema-ontology*](/api/tson).

It is organized by RDF *class* (*resource* in REST terms, *collection* in MongoDB terms).

Within the classes, you can explore the [*properties*](#/props).

You can examine the RDF semantics of a classes and properties in the [*context*](#/context) sections.

You may also explorte the database (or *closed-world*, if you will) [attributes](#/db).

To better understand the relationships in the code, check out this
[Data Model Diagram](#{site_github}/data-model/)
