This page provides information on the current state of the data store. 

For each resource class you can find a count of resources belonging to that
class and a list of all indexed fields.

Indexed fields are those properties of a resource class that should be extra-fast
to query for.

Resource classes and indexed fields are linked to their schema representations,
counts to the triples view of the respective instances.

This way, you can get a comprehensive overview of all resources in the data
store and the semantics of the stored information.
