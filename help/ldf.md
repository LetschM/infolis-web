You can query our data using [Triple
Fragments](http://linkeddatafragments.org/). This basically allows for
filtering the statements based on combinations of subject, predicate and/or
object. For instance, fill in a URI in the subject field and you get all
statements about this subject.

Note: This service ist not yet fully functionable.
[Filtering by object](https://github.com/infolis/infolis-web/issues/67) is
not yet implemented and we know that there are bugs in filtering by subject and
predicate combinations. We would appreciate if you
[create an issue](https://github.com/infolis/infolis-web/issues) with an
example if you spot a problem.
