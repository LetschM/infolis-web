Feel free to look around and test our API. Basically, there are only two
essential methods for uploading files and executing an algorithm. Note
that uploaded files will not be available for download for copyright reasons.

Check out some [example URI
calls](https://github.com/infolis/infolis-web/wiki/API-calls-to-algorithms) an
get [URIs of example
resources](https://gist.github.com/bolandka/7b307b45f1f8b93e7b89)

During the execution of the algorithm, many additional resources are created to
reflect the status of the execution and the provenance chain for the produced
links. To create these resources and get access to them afterwards, we provide
many additional methods that you probably do not need to know about at the
beginning.

Note: This API is in rapid development. If you have problems using it or find a
bug, please [create an issue](https://github.com/infolis/infoLink/issues).
