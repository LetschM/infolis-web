Our data schema not only addresses the actual
[links](http://infolis.gesis.org/infolink/schema/EntityLink) between
publications and research data, but also contains the process model to obtain
these links by
[executing](http://infolis.gesis.org/infolink/schema/Execution)
[algorithms](http://infolis.gesis.org/infolink/schema/algorithm) by means of
our services. A higher-level description of the schema is provided
